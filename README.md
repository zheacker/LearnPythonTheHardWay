# Learn Python The Hard Way
This is my repo for working through the *Learn Python the Hard Way* book, found [here](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). This will be my foundational crash course in python before I move on to *Test Driven Development* and, eventually, the python data science realm.

This book is in python 2, which dude says is 100% the way to go. Whatever. I'll just learn both and say fuck it... Regardless, I'm not going to use Docker at all. I've installed Anaconda 3, and I'm going to try to use a conda python 2 environment for this whole book. We'll see how it goes.

Final point: this is *Learn Python* ***the Hard Way***. Read every single sentence. Type every single command. I have a hunch this book is more about programming "muscle memory" than anything else.
